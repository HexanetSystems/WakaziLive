# User Controller
## Reuse of Index Logic in orders:

    The orders() method simply calls index(), as they both display the same data. This avoids code duplication.
## Eloquent Query Enhancements:

    - In the index method, I retrieve all orders at once, then filter them for pending and complete statuses, which minimizes database queries.
    - The order($id) method checks if the specified order belongs to the authenticated user before attempting to retrieve it.
## Redirect with Error Messages:

    Added error handling for cases where an order is not found or already deleted. This provides better feedback to the user.
## Profile Update:

    Replaced manual array update with Eloquentâ€™s update() method, which is cleaner and avoids using raw queries.
## Order ID and Invoice Generation:

    Simplified thankYou() by handling the order ID incrementation directly. This avoids conditional logic when determining the latest order ID.
## Clearer Variable Naming:

    Used clearer variable names (userId instead of Auth::User()->id) to improve readability and make the code consistent across methods.
